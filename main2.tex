\large\textbf{I Dreamt of Death}
\end{center}

% Dread should be a character.
% personify dread everywhere there is fear.

% Avoid contractions
% "Quilifiers are the leeches that infest the pond of prose,
%  sucking the blood of words" (clearly, many, really)
% Avoid using 'certainly'
% Prefer positive form instead of negative of sentences (not everywhere)
% Avoid 'would', it weakens the sentence

\noindent
Dread.
Dread is beautiful--it is salacious--it is engrossing--it
gives reason to action and inaction.
Dread captivates the mind and disheartens and depresses
those gripped by its claws.
% though fear is much better--it is shorter--it is sweeter.
I have always been fond of the dark and of terror--what
lurks inside the minds of men--since in my years
I have looked--I have seen the depths of Hell
and gleamed a glimmer of droll hostility
inhabiting the souls of those we call neighbors.
Is this why I find myself in question--constant question--by
the youth of this day as to my sanity?
I urge reconsideration of this preposterous proposition that
I, myself, am mad.
This world is unstable and, I, in time, a discrete blip--a
dull idea of light--lost to all who succeed my passing.
I am, most certainly, \textit{not} mad.

\noindent % reword this shit
Since the innocence I so longed to keep has fled me so,
I have no holds to tell this tale. %I have held close and closed.

\noindent
Years ago, on All Hollow's Eve,
I met the devil and she met me.
\VV


\noindent
In a manner, it was a party like any other.
Habitually incoherent by whiskey,
we all danced and laughed and reminisced of festivities past.
Half through the night, I spotted the dame,
vivacious and blond and standing alone with a beer.
And so I found myself there, next to the beauty,
exploring the corners of my sagacity with a horrid
grin and appalling optimism.
In memory I am certain that she was a friend of
a friend of a friend; to what end, I am unsure.
The details of the night were not entirely clear.
All I knew were those alluring eyes were drawing me in.
Captivated, entranced, and intoxicated,
I took the chance; the beer saw to that.
I thought it was fate for it is unusual
that a date follows such in-eloquent words
as mine in stupor.
But there they were, anomalous sounds,
silver words from a queen observing each
locality of my wildest dreams.


With the night fulfilled, we parted ways.
I waited in lust for days and days.
Only a week lay between then and our meeting,
but the hours were too long for my perplexed anxiety;
And with my want came the first sign that this woman may not be divine.


It was not my captivation.
It was not my intoxication.
It was the poison of thoughts.
The grand immaculation of the mind.
A spark of dread held so closely predestinate: dreams.
\VV


\noindent
Dreams are a world and they mirror our own.
They speak to our tears, our joys, and our fears.
I, at the time, was oblivious that the scenes they
showed were so linked to reality.


Perhaps I would have known had I listened--really listened--to
what Castaneda had to say.
He often spoke of Ixtlan,
a separate reality,
psychotropic in form,
a lucid plane on which he learned of the knowledge dreams hide.
I thought him mad, but now no longer;
for the same scrutinous eyes that looked so down upon him
have turned to me.
\VV


\noindent
The first of my dreams was subtle, a test, perhaps
for the waters were still murky and unclear.
\VV


\noindent
I sat in a tent with an eld' hag my opposite.
She begged me to drink the sands from a misplaced hourglass.


Bound in silver, the fragile glass construction had
carved upon the sheath a myriad of demons.
Red sand--a deep carmine--fell within.


Obediently I partook.


\noindent
I was in darkness, but a flame bobbed closer from a distance.


Decaying skin and ebony eyes peered at me from behind the light.
Crouching, disheveled, and doleful.
The more I looked, the more it stared.
And the more it stared, the more it dawned.
The creature was me and I was he.
We differed by skin and cloth; but our bones were one
and our eyes spoke the same.


The other me hobbled off down unknown ways.
I followed close over the wet of the fungi that
filled the cavity floor.
The passage stretched on for what seemed like miles.
I tired and slowed and the light become a distant memory.
But I continued onward, following the walls with my hands.


I miss-turned in the black and my feet met an edge.
With my senses dulled by isolation, I responded too late.
The greeting was over and this fall my fate.
\VV


\noindent % reword
The first date came--a fantasy.
I could think of none better. % 'could' weakens the sentence
She took me through the woods wherein laid a garden--a
secret--a haven--the hidden refuge where
the last of the bloodflowers grew.
We walked and we walked for what seemed like hours
while she told me stories of her former home.
I fell fascinated--intrigued--by the lips
upon which those words came--supple and pale.


With our heads lain against a tree we
fell into the languid tranquility of the garden.
I closed my eyes and let the cool breeze envelope me
and urge me to sleep. All was quiet and I at peace.


I awoke in pain.
A force--a hand--wrapped around my throat--until I screamed.
That whore of a woman had her hands on me!
Confused and in fear I laid still
with her grinning ear to ear.
Quickly! How quickly did that expression change!
Once a smirk and then concern.
``I am sorry'' she pleaded, her tone never sweeter.
Oh how I regret my stupidity!
How I curse my love-tainted heart!
For despite that feeling--
that tyrannical grip--that lingered on my larynx--
I caved and forgave that iridescent witch.


That night I dreamt again; a dream more suspicious;
a dream more fanatical but ever more clear.
A fear of that woman who grinned ear to ear. % Repetition bad.
\VV


\noindent
Deep in the forest--a clearing--where a mansion lay.
Luxurious--it was--unimaginably so.
Immaculate mosaics--stained in glass--flanked the walls.
Inside--there she stood, draped in a soft violet nightgown,
adorning the balcony overlooking the foyer.


A pentacle star--vermilion--ornate--obscured the floor.
She stood without trace of lunacy--without
maniacal ambition.
I do not know of what, but her eyes--her eyes
shown with a want so embolden to drive
such incredulous lengths.
They concentrated on the star--not
glazed--not soft, but astute; and with
that focus she articulated a hideous prayer.

\noindent % Shity paragraph
The grand redwood doors guarding the mansion burst in
before she completed the ritual.
I did not see the nature of the beast who so defiled the
beauty of those doors.
She ran, in search of eascape.
She hurled a doily-laden table through the largest
of the mosaics and leapt through the opening
into the lake below.


Her nightgown hugged tight to her licentious body
as she pulled herself from the water.
Therefound a lone hermit--haggard--unplaced.


``The Black Bishop on whom thou hast tempted
with blood seeks thou his bride.''
\VV


\noindent
The dream--short, but to a point--solidified my thoughts as dread.
Still, I reserved myself from such atrocity.
For the solemn hours I spent in solitude through the nights
overcame my judgement.
Such a frail girl.
What had I to fear?
The glow from her silken blond hair in evening light?
The pale complexion of her skin, almost translucent at times?
Her chin--rounded in such adorable symetry?
Or was it those eyes? Those endearing green eyes?
Those eyes for which countless nations might rise and fall?
I had fallen for that succubus.
She had stollen my heart and my groin;
and my brain no longer won.
\VV


\noindent
I may be a romantic; but I urge you, I am no fool.
I personally planned the second of our dates--a public venue--a symphony.


We arived seperately; I saw to that.
With no time to socialize we swiftly found our seats.
The concert hall held a certain radiance--an elegance
so vivid--so unadorned.
The orchestra, all with brass or wood, seemlessly--flawlessly--followed
the maestro's hypnotic hands.


Oh, how quickly it concluded; and how quickly the night turned.
We talked of the music--those enthralling notes.
Her voice was smooth--it soothed my soul--it purified
the damned--the dread in my gut.
Before long, I had forgotten myself.


I brought her home; a horrible mistake.
We laid together in my unkept room.
How perfect it seemed--how
absolutely perfect--the
softness of her skin--that
low moaning sigh.
I held her tight, not wishing for an end.
\VV


\noindent
With my lust exhausted--my stamina drained--I fell unconcious.
\VV


\noindent
It might have been the nails driven into my exposed amdomine
or it might have been the sadistic titilation on her face,
but I finally had suspect of foul-play.
I threw the bitch off, wincing in pain.
I ordered her out and she followed suit.
She left so obediently--so suspciciously--
at the time, however, the nails concerned me.


I wondered long if she remembered my address.
With the sanctity of my home tainted, I needed to move.
I spent the day packing and nursing my wound.
No time to leave; I simply boarded my home--every
window--every door--every vent upon the floor--no
crevice left exposed.
I did not care if I might suffocate on stale air--if
it meant her unable to choke me first.


My anxiety grew and grew, but still I slept
with adulation for my sagacious sealing.



% I found myself aface a dragon of <descript>.
% It spoke to me a pale prophecy
% I found the stones from which it described
% <prophecy poem>
% I found her and she took me to the island.
% I dug in the location specified.
% She put a hatchet in my skull, the hole my grave.


% Frighted, I knew what I must do.
% I must save myself from her.
% So I planned--so cunning--so auspitious--that
% she would never suspect.
% I invited her out, one last time,
% to that garden where the blood flower lay.
% I noted the hole, the gaping pit.
% I thought I saw a flicker of light.
% We trecked on.
% My confidence was wavering; I no longer resolved.
% But I hastened my faulter.
% I drove the axe into her neck--over and over--untill her head rolled (and rolled).
% The deed complete I went on my way home.
% I took down the boards, they no longer were needed.


% The next day her body was found.
% They closed up the garden, trespasers beware.


% A months time went by before the funeral came.
% I hazarded a show, I had words to say.
% I spoke at her funeral, of her beauty that I loved.
% I hugged her family.  I gave condolences to her friends.
% No one would ever suspect it were my hand.
% They had sewn her head back on, covering the seam with a choker.
% Her corpse was lovely and for her I still lusted.


% That night I had my final dream.
% <suicide>


% And with its passing my torment never stopped.
% I preached for years on the power of dreams.
% Every night I heard her dreadful screams as I hacked and hacked away her head.
% The resounding voice of mephastophalese:
% ``For this is Hell nor am I out of it''


% And so, with this my final work, I hope my lessons have helped a few souls.
% It is now time for me to rest and join the evil that has plagued me so.
% For there is no longer way for me to escape a fate in Hell.




% It were here where first became aware of foul-play
% It was quite clear. She played with Hell.
% and Hell took her apart.

French poem in main story.  This is to show a mixing of the dream story into reality (lots of silly songs):
  Mon, para-ti, vous...

Main story:
  Start second day:
    Door already unlocked ; "I must be late"
	Walk in, describe surroundings.
	  Everything is the same. <same is good blah blah>.
	  The floor, the stairs, the roaster in the corner, it's on
	  (later add something about the roaster billowing smoke and
	   Avril rushing to open the door...)
	  Then notice that one of the tables is in the wrong position.
	  Go to move it while Avril takes care of the customer before you.
	  Avril takes the man's order, then goes to the edge of the counter
	  to ask what you're doing.  Explain moving the table to it's rightful
	  spot... get in line as Avril is finishing the first customers drinks
	  Two medium vanilla lattes. One double-cupped.



Dream story:
  Pixel needs to do something with the other two birds (Dove and Pidgen).  Then
  Ugly and Yolo show up and Pixel just loses interest in the birds.
  Use the name Betelgeuse and Bellatrix?
  Maybe Castor, Altair, Gienah, Pollux, Vega?

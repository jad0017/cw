I Dreamt of Death and How She Would Kill Me
Wednesday, October 28th

Same bat-cave.
Same bat-time.
Like usual, Avril was talking about something trivial.
Talk, talk, talk,
Is that all women do? Sometimes I regret this cycle I’ve fallen into.
Work. Coffee. Work. Everyday. No exceptions. What are weekends for again? Oh, right, more work.
“. . . and Eric just wouldn’t stop taking shots. So I left him there.”
I wasn’t paying much attention before that. Eric was just an alcoholic asshole. It’s always the same story.
“That’s horrible, Avril. He really should have stopped when you asked. Especially after those DUIs.”
Of which he’s had three.
I hate auto-pilot conversations. But I’m a nice guy and I wouldn’t want to be rude. So I let her continue.
“I know! And that’s not even the worst of it! His friend, Jake, brought him back past midnight and woke
me up. They were covered in mud! It was all over the carpets, Quaid! I had to help him into the bathroom
where he threw up everywhere. I was so angry, Quaid. So angry. I yelled at him a little.”
Avril’s expression showed a sliver of guilt. She’s extremely easy to read and I like that. It’s nice when people
are more predictable. When she feels guilty she often raises her eyebrows, just so, showing off those lovely
green eyes. Then she curls her upper lip with a soft bite. If she’s feeling really guilty, she will tap the tips
of her index fingers together about waist-high. No tapping this time. She must have felt at least somewhat
justified. I was obliged to agree.
“I felt really bad. . . he started crying and apologizing and saying that he was going to lose me if he
doesn’t stop drinking.” Avril continued, her voice becoming more and more child-like. Another of her habits.

1

“I don’t know what to do, Quaid.”
I sighed. There’s always something stupid going on.
“You shouldn’t worry, Avril. It was his fault. He needs to stop drinking so much.” I said on cue.
“Maybe. . . ” She said, conceding slightly, “Sorry if I’m talking too much. You probably have to go back
to work.”
Avril started fidgeting. Great. Was she nervous? Expectant? I don’t friggen know. Regardless, she does
this too often.
“Never apologize to me for speaking. How many times must I say it? We are friends because I find what
comes out of your mouth– that raw manifestation of self that is so utterly, undeniably you– to be interesting.
I adore conversing with you and hearing what you have to say. There’s no need to apologize.” I replied,
managing to spare a brief smile.
She blushed slightly and thanked me with a soft “awww”. Annoying.
She made some comment to the effect of “We’re friends because I wanted us to be. Not you.”
Really? I remember it perfectly. I don’t forget things, not like this. Roughly two years ago, I walked into
the caf´e expecting the oddly chipper voice of Emma to greet me. Instead, I found this petite brunette who
didn’t look to be older than 20. She was quiet. Everyone is at first. I think it’s my face. It scares people.
Apparently I look like a serial killer. Resting Serial Killer-Face. Why? I don’t know. I’m quite fond of my
face. Do I need to smile?
Several months had gone by since Avril had taken over the morning shifts from Miss Emma. Slowly I
had gotten her to speak, but she was still behaving shyly. One day she had asked me about my weekend
and so I told her a tale of a friend’s depressing birthday.
“I would have told all those bitches off if it were mine.” She said as she threw her arms into the air with
an obvious tone of annoyance.
It wasn’t much, but I couldn’t help but grin. Finally an unexpected response. She was now more than
just some stupid existence. I wouldn’t have quite called her interesting at this point, but I knew she had

2

potential.
She was still very guarded around me which meant I needed to put in some work.
Over the next two months I changed how I spoke to appear more endearing. Tone and inflection can do a
significant amount of work, but those are often not good enough. To really create that feeling of trust in
another individual body language is important.
I would ask about her life with a smile. I hate smiling. While listening, I would give a slight tilt of my
head to expose my neck. The neck tilt is incredibly useful. It shows that an individual trusts you enough
to expose themselves to attack. Couple that with raised eyebrows, one slightly above the other, to show a
genuine expression of concern when appropriate and I was on the fast track to my goal. The expression
around the eyes really do the heavy lifting. If I couldn’t nail that then I would have come across fake.
There were times where I thought I was going to fail. Times when she closed up. Times when I thought
I’d lose my new toy. The hand covering the nape of the neck? Usually a good sign that a line was crossed
and the target is becoming defensive. Fidgeting often? Also a great tell of nervousness. But those are just
the common ones.
Luckily I didn’t make too many poor advances. By the third month I had her telling me enough intimate
details of her life to build a very good profile. I build mental profiles for everyone. With enough information
an individual becomes predictable. When they’re predictable it’s much easier to show to them that you care.
And that’s exactly what I did. I made her believe that I cared about her. Once that had been established,
everything else was just easy. Easy tends to mean boring. I did become bored with her a bit over the last
year or so. I’m maintaining our friendship though, because it may be of use later. I suppose if I were mean
I’d have dropped it already. But I’m not mean, just a bit manipulative. Purely for sport, of course.
I turned and left for work where I did nothing but work. It’s all very technical really, working, you have to
do things that you don’t want to do and talk to people you just want to punch. There’s a certain tact that’s
required to not punch someone in the face. I swear, when someone even gets close to a slide deck their IQ
drops significantly.
Have you ever listened to someone try to spruce up a boring talk with stale jokes that just cause moronically long pauses that slow the presentation down? It’s like a slow death only you don’t die at the end.
You just revive so that you can experience it all over again in a few minutes, then a few hours, the next day,

3

weeks, months,

years!

For this is hell, nor am I out of it.

The day spun into night.
The events that transpire in darkness are often the most curious.
I lied awake, begging the celestial to free my mind from corporeal strains.
The darkness opened and spoke to me.
Dark clouds, demonic billows surrounding me;
Soundless, eternal, yet turbulent tongue;
No whispers came but the silence sang.
In a grove, half-buried in ferns,
Dead, the devil’s moose with gilted horns.
In a great hall, chilled upon a moor,
Dead, Grendel’s head rolled across the floor.
Bone–freed from flesh–
Without shape accustom to life.
Strewn, diabolical, from ivory throne.
Abysmal cries where calamity lies.
Space contorted, a kiss by pentacle star,
Where the spinner haunts the dark,
and hysteria resides.
Ethereal transposed to Earth-bound ears.
The Sovereignty fiending reality;
The misbegotten provoking malady;
Celestial rhythm corrupting my soul.
Frivolously, I wrote and wrote and wrote. A veritable tale from the twilight muse.
Thursday, October 29th

The scenery in the caf´e was as normal as could be. It’s so nice when everything is consistent. The worn floor
beneath my feet winked at me where the ceiling leaked. The stairs, leading up to the second floor, were still
faded and the name, Caf´e Breleir, could still barely be made out on the first step despite the blacks being
much less black than they should and the browns all starting to look the same. The roaster was chugging
along in the corner by the door with a horrible groan and an utter refusal to die. The wooden frame fencing
4

the monstrosity in was as ugly as always. Shoddy workmanship never fails to make me cringe. It’s far too
easy to measure and align wood for a simple structure.
Avril was working again. No surprises there. Her schedule is remarkably consistent in comparison to the
other baristas. Maybe it’s because she’s a “manager”. Though that word doesn’t seem to have quite the
same meaning there as in other retail. For the large majority of the business hours, there is only one barista
on schedule. They do double up briefly in the hours around shift changes which coincide with the expected
high points: lunch and dinner.
One of the tables was out of place. I’m disappointed at how long it took me to notice.
Normally all the furniture is put back into place. I could have let it be. . . but then it would have stayed
that way for a while.
The table was light, no trouble to lift. I carefully set the table down in a more appropriate–the most
appropriate–place: right where it belongs.
“What are you doing?” Avril asked from behind me.
She had walked over to the edge of the bar after taking the order of the older man who arrived before me.
“The table’s position was bothering me.”
“Okay Quaid.” she said, laughing slightly before returning to the espresso machine to make the man’s
drinks.
The man is always there. . . What’s his name? Name. . . Dameon! His name is Dameon. I swear he comes
in two or more times a day. Always ordering the same thing.
“Two medium vanilla lattes!” Avril called from the end of the bar.
Dameon was waiting patiently to grab Avril’s attention as I approached the front counter. She forgot to
double-cup one of the lattes. One of them is always double-cupped.
Realizing her mistake, Avril apologized while sliding another cup under one of the drinks.
“Thanks Avril”, said Dameon. He took the drinks, walking up the stairs to, no doubt, the single table

5

in the far corner. It’s a good spot. It has the most comfortable chairs.
“What do you want?”, Avril said with a rebellious air.
She knew what I wanted. I wasn’t about to give in. Remaining silent, I continued looking at her with a
smile. I knew I’d win.
“Grr! A coffee? Fine.”
While handing her my card, I switched to a grin.
“Gah,” she said softly, returning my card, “Quaid, I don’t want to be here!”
“Oh Avril. As pleasant as always.” I said while sighing.
I don’t think a day goes by where she doesn’t say something similar. Every time, she gives me this odd look
look with a left-tilted head and a weak smile. Then she drops her shoulders, rolling her back. Sometimes
she places her hands on the counter and stretches out her spine. Sometimes she squats down, trying to hide.
This time she just straightened back up.
“Jasmine is being a butt. . . ”
Looks like another good rant for my coffee.
“So, I had to take a box of chips from the other store because we’re almost out here. She keeps asking
for them back but I know they don’t sell enough sandwiches for that. I even went and checked the stock, but
she keeps insisting! And then she’s was mad because of overtime. . . Wait, I told you about the overtime,
right?”
I raised an eyebrow.
“Oh, I thought I told you. Yeah. She’s the one that goes and picks up our checks from the banks and
she saw mine. By state law, employers’ don’t even have to give overtime pay. But Mike actually pays us
time-and-a-half if we work over 88 hours in the pay period. Like, up to 88 is just normal pay. Well, last
paycheck she had worked 86.5 hours and apparently felt like she deserved overtime. She asked me last week
when we were working together if I received overtime. So I told her I did. I wasn’t going to lie. I worked
113 hours last week, Quaid.” She said, stopping to take a small, yet audible, breath. “She got an attitude

6

and asked why and I told her that you only get overtime for hours over 88.”
I gave some bullshit responses: “She really shouldn’t have looked at those paychecks”, “Jasmine should know
the rule”, etc. Avril wasn’t quite finish though.
“And then yesterday I had to go to the store because of those chips, but the van wont start and Mike
wont fix it because he only ever comes back in town for the night to check up on things. He told me to go
do it, but I don’t have time. So I just took my car which only holds maybe half of what I need to get in a
trip.”
She stopped again for a breath. This time slowly in, slowly out. She relaxed her eyes as she did.
“It’s okay. Everything is okay.” she said. “This is how adults do things. They manage their stress, right?”
“You’re such a good adult, Avril.” I smiled. “I’ve seen you get through worse, you’ll be fine.”
She gave me one of those adorable pouts again. I ignored it. She needed to be teased.
Eventually she asked what I’ve been up to, apologizing first of course. I swear some people are just naturally
and disgustingly apologetic.
“I had a weird dream,” I explained, “would you like to hear it?”
“Yeah!” she exclaimed with a child’s enthusiasm for adventure and a voice to match.

“
“Just a taste,” the witch said urging me to drink from an ornate hourglass.
The hourglass was bound in silver on both ends with two silver dowels adding support to the
fragile glass structure. Carved into the housing were little figures of men–some with horns,
others with wings. There was a tiny hing and a latch on top. Held in the glass was a mound
of red sand pilling up slowly.
I didn’t bother asking why. I popped open the latch and knocked it back like a shot.
Unfortunately the tapering kept the stream slow and steady. It reminded me of a cherry Pixie
Stick. I choked for a bit, being suffocated by the granules. I could see the witch smiling as I
passed out.
I opened my eyes to pure darkness, save for a flickering light bobbling towards where I lay.

7

A creature with decaying skin and ebony eyes was staring at me from behind the light. It was
crouching. The more I looked, the more it stared. Hypnotized by it’s abyssal eyes gleaming in
the light, I saw that it–he–was me. A different me, but undeniably so.
“Welcome to the darkness.” The other me hissed.
The gray-skinned me hobbled off down some passage, invisible in the dark. I tried to stand, but
quickly found the ceiling too short. Crouching as well, I followed the light into the unknown.
The passage was musty and smelled of fungus. There were no seams nor mortar in the
walls from what I felt. Just solid concrete.
The light flickered out and the scraping of the creature’s nails stopped. I kept moving.
What laid before me I did not know. What laid behind me was likely no better.
The walls stayed solid, but soon, my feet found a ledge, and my mind too late. I slid off
the edge, my fingers bloodying as I tried to grip the concrete.
I woke as soon as I began to fall.
She told me it was a terrifying dream and then recounted one of her nightmares. Someone would break into
her apartment while she was sleeping and attack her. There were some oddities like the assailant walking on
hands and knees and Eric being around but just sleeping through everything. As far as dreams go, it was
fairly normal.

Amidst the horror of my dreams a spark of brilliance was turning into wildfire. Anthropomorphic creatures
were dancing around my head.

Once upon a lime in the Sour Green Valley, Ugly the Unicorn, fast asleep, dreamed of a day
where he were shaped like a potato instead of a yam. But the sweet, potato dreams would not
last. Ugly awoke with a frown, disappointed by his white, starchy body.
His disappointment didn’t last long——
A distinctive knock echoed through the house. . .

8

Knock-a-lock-lock-lock-knock-a-lock-lock
Knick-Knock Ka-knock-a-lock KA-PLOCK
Ugly jumped1 to his hooves, sending ripples across his girth that temporarily consumed his tiny
legs. Ugly knew this knock. There’s only one knocker with a knock so knockticular this side
of Knockington Central. Ugly the Unicorn unlocked the door and Yolo the Yodling Billygoat
forced his way in.
”Yodl-do Ugly”, Yolo said, ”how’re you?”
”Hey, Yolo”, said Ugly, sheepishly, ”I’m well. What brings you here?”
”Just felt like checking on you.”
”Oh, no one ever checks on me...”, said Ugly in a tone flat enough to bore a child to sleep.
Yolo ignored this.
”Hey, what do you say we yodle on down to the park and see what good ol’ Pixel is up
to?”
Pixel the Cat was always up to something. She once licked herself, and twenty-seven other
animals, raw to beat the world record for largest regurgitated hair ball. She broke the record
and dilapidated half of the village.
Currently, Pixel was staring attentively at a mismatched flock of birds and softly singing to
herself2 .

1 Jumping

is a bit misleading when referring to a creature as magnificent as Ugly. The movement was closer to a that of a
boastfully large ship sinking into the depths after an unfortunate run-in with a glacier that had a nasty case of the Mondays
and an adamant refusal to move.
2 Pixel is strongly under the mindset that singing, like nap time, is a necessity in life. Why, you can sing about anything:
gardening, baking cookies, setting up an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine to catch that pesky mouse who has alluded you for
so long. Yes, singing keeps the mind sharp. . . but not as sharp as Pixel’s claws.

9

Pixel’s song went a bit like this:
A goose, I spy, Greylag? Andean!
A dove, I see, Topknot? Mourn-ING!
I wonder–wonder–how they are–
Like Gull? Perhaps Vanga?
Another here. . . a pigeon too!
How I’d like a taste of you!
I’ll count to three and then I’ll spring!
And with my claws I’ll try to cling
Onto your juicy winged boooooooooodieess!
No sooner had Pixel’s song ended did she leap into the air toward the flock. The birds scattered.
This was of no consequence to Pixel. She, like many animals, loved a good chase. And this
chase was looking to be exemplary.
Garilda the Goose waddled into the nearby lake hoping the water would be safe from the cat.
Little did Garilda know, Pixel, unlike most domestic feline folk, loved the water. How could
she not? It was like bath time with larger, more feathered, less rubbered ducks.
Pixel slunk to the edge of the water on which the unsuspecting Garilda sat. She dipped a paw
in, slowly, sending a small rippled no more prominent than the fall of a leaf across the surface.
In moments, Pixel was in. She waded out a bit before submerging herself.

Glub—glub
Glub—glub
Glub–glub
Glub–glub glub–glub

glub–Glub

Pixel leapt from the water and latched onto the goose! Garilda flapped violently in an attempt

10

to stay afloat with her new found cat-skin-and-entire-body coat1 .
Alphard the Pidgen and Regulus the Dove, hearing Garilda struggle, rushed to the lake to save
her. Regulus flew to a nearby tree before diving, beak first, towards the cat. Pixel was far too
preoccupied struggling with the goose to notice such a tiny, insignificant bird flying right for
her head. Pixel let out a shriek.

Mrrroawwww
Pixel fell back into the water, releasing Garilda. The goose swam to the shore, reconveining
with her abnormal flock. Pixel dredged herself out of the water. She glared at birds from
across the lake2 .
Friday, October 30th

I didn’t know what to do with my morning. Avril wasn’t working today.
There was this other brunette working. She was short and wearing a light gray, deep-collared cardigan3
over a black shirt. It was a weird choice of color for working at a caf´e. I hope she didn’t stain it.
I’ve seen her in here before. I had assigned her the nickname “Bubbles” because she laughs at everything.
I’ve never bothered to learn her name. She bores me.
Since I didn’t have Avril around to make me special coffee4 , so I just ordered it black and went on my
way.
I left work early to take a nap. I was taking Avril to the symphony later. It would have been bad if that
headache remained. It’s funny how fucked up a night without sleep can make you.
My head was throbbing continually. I couldn’t think. It was like my mind was a colloid. A cloud
suspended in my brain.

1 A live cat is a hard look to pull off. Prassilla the Peacock once fashioned one for her Catmares collection last winter. It
was a sight to behold. The darling Miss Prassilla, in all her radiance, boldly strutting the runway with a tom cat clinging for
it’s life on her back. The colors of her tail feathers perfectly contrasting with the mangy gray fur of the cat. It was a wonder
if such extreme fashion would ever see the light of day again. Though, today, while clearly a knock-off, the onlookers of the
struggle between Garilda and Pixel could only be reminded of the brilliance of Prassilla’s design.
2 The glare is a stable of any good cat. A properly executed glare, enhanced with a tasteful snarl, can induce terror in even
the most fearless of creatures. Unfortunately for Pixel, the wet-cat look makes the effect almost comical.
3 I should get a cardigan. Something with nice thick nits and large black buttons. Every time I go shopping all I find are
thin cotton ones with zippers. I don’t want to look like Mr. Rogers. This isn’t story time in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe.
4 I honestly have no clue what I normally drink. Avril just works her coffee magic.

11

I picked up Avril from the coffee shop since she had to take inventory. Her outfit screamed secretary: a
tasteful black blouse; heathered gray pants, untappered; black heels with pointed caps. I was delighted to
find that she had opted for real pants this time, though a bit disappointed that she wasn’t wearing a dress.
At least we matched.
Originally I was going to try and pull off a look that I call “The Pumpkin Spice Latte”. It’s a very
technical outfit. The “Pumpkin Spice” base is a creme chambray shirt with an apricot wool tie held warmly
in place by a ginger, or possibly amber, knit sweater. The spice is wrapped up nicely in a fitted tweed suit
with a knit pocket square, color-matched to the sweater. The shoes are the most crucial part. Black shoes
cause too much contrast on the lower body with the beautiful layering exposed between the jacket’s lapels.
Instead this ensemble needs well colored pair of brown Oxfords with a clean cap toe,none of that wing-tip
bullshit. Nothing too dark as it might blend in with the tweed. Nothing too light as the color may draw
attention away from the upper body. The fit needs a good middle-ground. Something in a nice bronze might
do.
Sadly my tie was more of a carrot than an apricot and that just wouldn’t do. I was forced to go with my
alternate, “The Oxford Professor”. A navy jacket worn over a burgundy argyle sweater, white chambray,
and navy tie. The pants were heathered gray, though a shade lighter than Avril’s, finished off with a pair of
untipped black Oxfords. A pocket square would have made this outfit too formal, so I left the blazer bare.
“Hey,” she said softly, “you look snazzy.”
“Hey” can be said with a million varied tones, but, for some reason, her’s always sound so off when she
greets me outside of work.
“And you look like you’re ready for business.”
“Yeah, when Casey saw me she said I looked like I’m either going to an interview or on a date. I hadn’t
told her about orchestra.”
We both laughed. It really wasn’t a date. She really wanted to go but Eric doesn’t like the symphony. I
offered to taker her instead. I love any chance to dress up.
After small talk was out of the way, I drove us to the concert hall. We didn’t talk the entire time.
We arrived a little late, but still with enough time to grab a drink from the bar before finding our seats.
The orchestra was already seated, waiting for the maestro. The concert was Halloween themed for
October and every musician was in costume. None of them really stood out. There was a pharaoh on French

12

Horn and the pope had a tuba.
A recording was played on the speakers of an over dramatized voice welcoming us to the show. It reminded
me of the intermissions of the old Fright Night marathons that my father and I used to watch together.
The voice cut out and the conductor walked on stage. He bowed, the collar of his Dracula costume
flopping to one side.
It had been a long time since I’d heard such scores. The selection was largely from the films of Hitchcock
with an occasional piece from Fantasia or Peer Gynt.
I think I was happy.
Then the intermission came and Avril had to open her mouth. She told me she was breaking up with Eric. I
was elated to hear those words. Eric was never good enough for Avril. Too often I had to comfort her after
an argument. Too long have I urged her to sit him down and discuss their relationship. I was hoping they
could at least resolve their issues, but after the recent spike of alcohol related stupidity, a break up is much
more appropriate.
She went on though. She couldn’t leave it at that.
“I’m in love with someone else,” she said, “Do you remember James?”
Of course I remember fucking James! It was obvious that she was attracted to him. Hell, the guy even told
her that he liked her, but he was married. Avril asked him to come talk to her if they ever divorced. I didn’t
see that coming.
“He’s taking me to the mountains in the middle of November for a vacation. He told me I work too
much. I’ve already been out with him a couple of times. Does that make me a bad person? Going out while
I’m still living with Eric. . . ”
I had to think over my response and try not to cringe. She developed commitment issues after Blake had
cheated on her. And then this? This isn’t suppose to happen. This is too fast. Too unpredictable.
I responded with some shit about how it’s normal and that it’s okay but I would have preferred if she
had broken it off with Eric first.
“Opportunities don’t often wait. Just try not to do it again. You remember what Blake did to you.”
I would have liked to have just ended it there. I really didn’t have enough alcohol for this. She just constantly

13

bombards me with these trite matters like rocks beneath a waterfall of words.
“I think he loves me.”
Great.
“But I don’t think I’m good enough for him.” Her voice became smaller. Even puppies learn from their
mistakes, but her? I think she just likes my lecturing.
“Look, Avril,” I began, “No one is too good for you.”
“But he’s really successful and I look at my life and I’m just a barista. I haven’t gone anywhere at 30.”
How many times can I sigh in one conversation before it becomes obscene?
“First, you aren’t 30 yet. You’re 29. Second, If I thought you weren’t going anywhere in life, do you
really think I’d be your friend? Do you really think we’d be sitting here right now?”
I wasn’t exactly convinced of that, but it didn’t matter if I was convinced. Only that I was convincing.
“You’re right. . . ” She didn’t sound too sure.
“You know you can trust me.”
She shook her head in acknowledgment. I guess she had to think through the worry.
The remainder of the symphony was just as spectacular as the first half. I was almost sad that we had to
leave.
I dropped her back off at her car. We didn’t speak again in the car. She just had this worried look on her
face the whole time. Parallel eyebrows, scrunching her nose. She was rolling the right half of her bottom lip
gently between her teeth. This caused the left half to poof out just a bit. It’s no use trying when she’s like
this. She’ll work it out. She’s an adult despite how childish she acts.
She thanked me for taking her to the orchestra around five times as she was exiting the car. I swear she
tries too hard. I told her once was enough. I got a small smile out of that.
I wished her goodnight and set off for home.
Monday, November 2nd

Avril is starting to bore me. I don’t recall what we were talking about. I don’t really care anymore. It’s all

14

frivolous.
Oh, some 18 year old boy was accused of rape by some 16 year old girl who got way too drunk and
decided the next morning that she had made a mistake? The fuck do I care what happens to an unlucky
boy and a stupid little cunt?
Eventually she asked me how my day was again. I uttered the usual “good” and starting on with another
dream. I’m getting concerned by these.

“
I was standing in a park reminiscent of Georges Seurat’s “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island
of La Grande Jatte”. There were countless people looking out onto a crystal clear pond. They
were faceless yet unique. A women sat on her knees, shaded by a parasol. She wore a long
pink skirt with an orange top and hat. She was picking flowers. Several dogs were wandering
happily. A couple of men were relaxing in the shade, smoking on pipes. I was absorbed into
the tranquility of the park, falling lethargic in the shade of a nearby tree.
The sky turned dark and the world was suddenly stained, monochromatic, with red. A
dozen hooded figures stormed the park, killing everyone in sight. I ran, avoiding the fallen
bodies. There wasn’t anywhere to go except to the water. I thought I might be able to hide
under the surface, or at least reach the opposite shore.
I stopped just short of the lake’s edge and gazed out over the bloody water. The surface
bubbled, molten. A great black spire erupted from the water. The imposing figure of the tower
seemed to look down on the world– to look down on me. I dropped to my knees. I could hear
footsteps in a slow stride echoing in the hollow air.
“You can never run from me.”
The voice was taunting and familiar. There was a click and I was dead.
With my conscious free from my body, I saw that the killer was me. I drifted into his head.
From his–my–eyes I saw a cop lying on the ground. He was bleeding out but still moving. He
pulled his arms out in front of his prone body. He was holding a pistol. Shaking violently, he
shot. The bullet penetrated my heart. I could feel the force tearing my flesh.
Again, I was dead.

I Dreamt of Death
Dread. Dread is a beautiful word, though fear is much better–it is shorter–it is sweeter. I have always been
fond of the dark and of terror–what lurks inside the minds of men–since in my years I have looked with
words at the depths of Hell and gleamed a glimmer of droll hostility inhabiting the souls of those we call
neighbors. Is this why I find myself in question–constant question–by the youth of this day as to my sanity?
I urge reconsideration of this preposterous proposition that I, myself, am mad. This world is unstable and,
I, in time, a discrete blip–a dull idea of light–lost to all who succeed my passing. I am, most certainly, not
mad.
Since the innocence I so longed to keep has fled me so, I have no holds to tell this tale.
Years ago, on All Hollow’s Eve, I met the devil and she met me.
In a manner, it was a party like any other. Habitually incoherent by whiskey, we all danced and laughed and
reminisced of festivities past. Half through the night, I spotted the dame, vivacious and blond and standing
alone with a beer. And so I found myself there, next to the beauty, exploring the corners of my sagacity with
a horrid grin and appalling optimism. In memory I am certain that she was a friend of a friend of a friend;
to what end, I am unsure. The details of the night were not entirely clear. All I knew were those alluring
eyes were drawing me in. Captivated, entranced, and intoxicated, I took the chance; the beer saw to that. I
thought it was fate for it is unusual that a date follows such in-eloquent words as mine in stupor. But there
they were, anomalous sounds, silver words from a queen observing each locality of my wildest dreams.
The night fulfilled, we parted ways. I waited in lust for days and days. It was just a week before we were
set to meet, but the hours were too long for my perplexing anxiety. With my want came the first sign that
this woman may not be divine.
It was not my captivation. It was not my intoxication. It was the poison of thoughts. The grand
immaculation of the mind. A spark of dread held so closely predestinate: dreams.
Dreams are a world and they mirror our own. They speak to our tears, our joys, and our fears. I, at the
time, was oblivious that the scenes they showed were so linked to reality.
Perhaps I would have known had I listened–really listened–to what Castaneda had to say. He often spoke
of Ixtlan, a separate reality, psychotropic in form, a lucid plane on which he learned of the knowledge dreams
hide. I thought him mad, but now no longer; for the same scrutinous eyes that looked so down upon him

1

have turned to me.
The first of my dreams was subtle, a test, perhaps for the waters were still murky and unclear.
I sat in a tent with an eld’ hag my opposite. She begged me to drink the sands from a misplaced hourglass.
Bound in silver, the fragile glass construction had carved upon the sheath a myriad of demons. Red
sand–a deep carmine–fell within.
Obediently I partook.
I was in darkness, but a flame bobbed closer from a distance.
Decaying skin and ebony eyes peered at me from behind the light. Crouching, disheveled, and doleful.
The more I looked, the more it stared. And the more it stared, the more it dawned. The creature was me
and I was he. We differed by skin and cloth, but our bones were one and our eyes spoke the same.
The other me hobbled off down unknown ways. I followed close over the wet of the fungi that filled the
cavity with must. The passage stretched on for what seemed like miles. I tired and slowed and the light
become a distant memory. But I continued onward, following the walls with my hands.
I miss-turned in the black and my feet met an edge. With my senses dulled by isolation, I responded too
late. The greeting was over and this fall my fate.
The first date was a fantasy. I could think of none better. She took me through the woods of wherein
laid a garden–a secret–a haven–known only by few. We walked and we walked for what seemed like hours
while she told me stories of her former home. I fell facinated–intrigued–by the lips upon which those words
came–suple and pale.
With our heads lain against a tree we fell into the languid tranquillity of the garden. I closed my eyes
and let the cool breeze envelope me and sing me to sleep. All was quiet and I at peace.
I awoke in pain. A force–a hand–wrapped around my throat–until I screamed. That whore of a woman
had her hands on me! Confused and in fear I laid still with her grinning ear to ear in front of me. Quickly!
How quickly did that expression change! Once a smirk and then concern. “I am sorry” she pleaded, her tone
never sweeter. Oh how I regret my stupidity! How I curse my love-tainted heart! For despite that feeling–
that tyranical grip–that lingered on my larnyx– I caved and forgave that iridescent witch.
That night I dreamt again; a dream more suspicious; a dream more fanatical but ever more clear.
Deep in the forest–a clearing–where a mansion lay. Luxurious–it was–unimaginably so. Immaculate mosaics–
stained in glass–flanked the walls. Inside–there she stood, draped in a soft violet nightgown, adorning the

2

balcony overlocking the foyer.
A pentical star–vermillion–ornate–obscured the floor. She chanted without trace of lunacy–without
maniacal ambition. I do not know of what, but her eyes–her eyes shown with a want so embolden to
drive such incredulous lengths. They concentrated on the star–not glazed–not soft, but astute; and with
that focus she articlated a hideous prayer.
Oremus
Grandis Spiritus Diabolus
Eleves legionis
Oremus
E nomine
Dominus Apostolicus

Oremus
Educet dolorem
Et exigere vindictam
The grand redwood doors guarding the place burst in! A glimpse–a taste–of the creatures who defiled the
beauty was all I saw before she ran to safety. But safety was not found in the mansion. She hurled a
doily-laiden table through the largest of the mosaics and lept through the opening into the lake below.
Her nightgown hugged tight to her licentious body as she pulled herself from the water. Therefound a
lone hermit–haggard–unplaced.
“The Black Bishop on whom thou hast tempted with blood seeks thou his bride.”

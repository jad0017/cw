- Did I really just write about a crazed lady trying to kill me? -

Evil is never so obvious
  as others may lead you to believe.

I first met the devil
  some winter's eve,
... or was it before
... when the leaves began to fall?

Regardless, the encounter was
... a marvelous sight.
The jitters I felt
... still keep me well into the night.

Beautiful, was she, with lovely brown hair,
... an adorable chin
... endearing eyes
... and a playful grin.

She spoke softly with a voice
  that might purify the damned,
  but now I know all she spoke were lies.

At the time, all seemed right in the world.

Together, we visited a garden
  known only to few.
A secret haven where
  the blood flower once grew.

The hours were long, but still they fled.
So, relaxed, aside a tree, I laid my head.

I closed my eyes
  and let the cool breeze envelope me
  in languid tranquillity.

... and when I awoke,
... well,
... I found a knife against my throat.

She laughed it off,
  with eyes filled with glee.

Now, you must be thinking,
  this bitch is crazy
... and at the time,
  I don't know that I cared.

I was entranced by that tempress--
  whose skin was smooth and fair--
  whose speech was a ballad sung only for me.

My heart was caged and she held the key.

Again, one day, I'd felt at ease
  as the sun began to set,
  she whispered in my ear
  a serenade to sleep.

This time, I awoke with screams
  to a sharp pain deep in my chest
  with my adored smiling over me
  and nails protruding my baren flesh.

The fog had cleared,
  as I cried in agony.

That Eldritch whore
  seemed hopeful for more.

So I ran to prevent my tradgedy.

I fled the region,
  for all that I dread
  might someday find
  and wish me dead.

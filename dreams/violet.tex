\noindent
A mansion, luxurious far beyond any imagination of the word,
sat in the middle of a forest, several miles from any town.
There were large, ornately carved wooden doors and
stained glass mosaics of the god of death and corruption, Deimos.


Inside there was a woman leaning against the second floor balcony
of the entrance hall.
She had blonde hair and wore an elegant, soft violet night gown.


A knocking came at the front door shattering the tranquility of the night.
The woman, alarmed that someone would actually know where to find her,
just kept staring at the door in fear.
The knocking came again.  It stopped and after a few minutes in silence
the doors burst open.


In stepped a large creature with eight thick spider-like legs with a man's
torso and fairly bulky arms--one of which, had what can only be described
as a claw, growing from it.
The head of the creature was human-shaped,
though it mostly resembled an ogre's.
Behind it stood a slightly smaller version of the same creature.


The larger of the two spoke in a loud, growling voice.
\VV


``This is now, and forever will be, my domain.''
\VV


\noindent
The girl panicked, and did what any self-respecting
female in a horror movie would do: she ran.
She ran toward the mosaic of Deimos overlooking the
lake behind the building.
With only one way out in sight,
she hurled the doilied hall table into the glass, shattering it.
While jumping off into the lake below,
she heard the \textit{thing} calling behind her:
\VV


``You can't run forever.''
\VV


\noindent
Dragging herself out of the water, she cautiously entered the forest.
After a few hours, she had exhausted the adrenaline that kept her
running and decided to rest for a moment or two.
Just as she had taken a seat,
she heard a rustling in the nearby overgrowth.
From the bushes, an old man wearing a dark cloak
stepped into the clearing.
\VV


``Where have you come from, my dear?''
\VV


\noindent
The girl said nothing.
\VV


``The mansion, eh?'' he said, ``Then you must be \april!''


``H-how do you know of me?''
\VV


\noindent
The hermit just smiled.
\VV


``I take it they found you? Well we better get going, then.''


``They?''


% Change name...
``\creaturenames.  Ugly nasty things.'' the man said while pushing
aside some nearby bushes, revealing a tunnel. ``Now come along.''


``Wait, where did they come from?''
\VV


\noindent
He sighed.
\VV


``Some time ago a group of those hapless wizards attempted
to raise the Black Bishop of Hell, when they were refused ice
cream with their apple pie.
The stupid fools managed to screw up the ritual.
Instead of raising the Bishop
they got a portal to the wrong layer of Hell and they couldn't
for the life of 'em figure out how to close it.
But they don't have to worry about that anymore.
No life left to be had.''


``Is there anything we can do, to stop the \creaturenames?''


``Well, you'd better come down into my cave.''
\VV


\noindent
Alice followed the man down the hole.
Once inside, the man walked over to a small table that supported a single object.
A staff of archaic design with a large multi-colored jewel dressing one end.
\VV


``This is the staff of Helios,'' he said, picking up the staff,
``It's an ancient tool that can only be controlled by a few of the gifted.''
\VV


\noindent
He presented it to her.
Alice reproachfully touched the staff.
The jewel began to shine in a rainbow of brilliance.
\VV


The hermit's eyes flashed as he said ``Helios seems to smile upon you.''


``Can this staff stop them?''


``It's quite possible.''


``How do I use it?''


``Engraved on the staff are the words
\textit{a' tuulo' i' mor-cevan, arphen od fatanyu}\footnote{
Pronunciation:
Ay tee-yew-lu e more say-van arf-in odd fate-an-you.
}.
I'd suggest you say them when faced with the beasts.''
\VV

% Stuff here?

\noindent
\april{} left the cave and headed swiftly to her mansion.
The small \creaturename{} was standing where the front doors once were.
\VV


``Hehehe, we've been waiting for you.'' taunted the little shit.
\VV


\noindent
The small \creaturename{} let her inside.
The larger one was sitting on the balcony.
The \textit{entire} balcony.
\VV


``I see you've decided to return.'' scoffed the larger \creaturename{}.
\VV


\noindent
\april{} pointed the staff of Helios and began chanting the Elvin words.
A majestic display of color and energy shot from the staff.
The big \creaturename{} laughed and stepped forward.
\VV


``You think \textit{that} can stop \textit{me}?''
\VV


\noindent
He took a swing at her with his clawed arm.
\april{} fell to the ground.
\VV


``I'll leave the rest to you.'' boomed the \creaturename.
\VV


The old man stepped into the room, smiling.
He took a knife from under his cloak and stabbed
\april{}'s limp body through the heart.
\VV


``\textit{O sereg ettul a ingole' o tofn ist. Eria mor-pen!}\footnote{
Pronunciation:
Oh sare-egg ett-ule ah ing-olly oh toff-in-ist.
Err-eye-a more-pen!
}''
\VV


\noindent
The blood flowing from her body began filling an intricate
engraving on the floor.
Once filled, the markings on the floor began to shine and a
black mist rose around her body.
A figure with a head full of needles appeared in the mist.


The Bishop was summoned at last and it was hungry.
It devoured \april's body in a matter of minutes.
The Bishop then turned towards the old man, still craving flesh.
The Bishop gripped it's jaw and pulled it down until it's mouth
spanned the entire height of the hermit.
With a single chomp, the old man was gone.


The Bishop walked out into the lusting for more.

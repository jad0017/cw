We walked through the woods,
past 


Tyranical grip lingered on my larnyx


Garden of the bloodflowers.

White: This dream errs on the silly but for what it showed, the climax
of my dread, I took as ever truth.

I dare not explain for what it is this dream had shown,
for time will tell, this I am sure.

I wish not to fall again to my death.

I am /not/ mad!
--
I met her at a party
--
I dreamt of a falling death
--
We went to the garden of the bloodflowers
--
I dreamt of her rituals
--
We went to the symphony orchestra (in public on purpose)
--
I dreamt of a suicide
--
??
--
I dreamt of a dragon and an arrow to my back
--
I resolved myself, in fear, to kill her
--
We went to the garden (now realizing the landmarks we passed)
--
I killed her and covered my tracks (someone else was in the garden)
--
I spent time in the hospital and being questioned
--
I went and spoke at her funeral
--
Would the red dream be better here? To end it all? The narator kills himself?


Remove the blooming of the blood flowers?
Should the narator believe this woman is truly a demonic being?
Should she revive or haunt his sleep or anything else since he did not remove her heart?
Should there be a section on magic, on tarot: XII Death could appear?
Should elaborate on why he has a hatchet and how it was not out of place.
Should explain the boarding and the haste.
Consider the woman never told of her dates.
The funeral could be the first the family ever heard of the narator.
The investigators could stop by after that and have a quick chat.
Should the narator slip and find himself in jail.
A sentence for life is one heck of a hell.
Elaborate on Castenada and his cult.  Our narator could be a member of it.

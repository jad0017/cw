We walked through the woods,
past 


Tyranical grip lingered on my larnyx


Garden of the bloodflowers.

White: This dream errs on the silly but for what it showed, the climax
of my dread, I took as ever truth.

I dare not explain for what it is this dream had shown,
for time will tell, this I am sure.

I wish not to fall again to my death.

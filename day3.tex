% Third Day -------------------------------------------------------------------
\noindent
\april{} is starting to bore me.
I don't recall what we were talking about.
I don't really care anymore.  It's all frivolous.


\textit{Oh}, some 18 year old boy was accused of rape by some
16 year old girl who got way too drunk and decided the
next morning that she had made a mistake?
The fuck do I care what happens to an unlucky boy and
a stupid little cunt?


Eventually she asked me how my day was again.
I uttered the usual ``good'' and starting on with another dream.
I'm getting concerned by these.
